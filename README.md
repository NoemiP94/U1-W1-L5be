# Java Practice ⚙️
This project was developed during EPICODE Back end's class.
It was necessary write Java code for the implementation of a multimedia player using the OOP principles.

### Description of the system:
- A Multimedia Element is an Image🖼️, a Video🎞️ or a Audio Record🎵 identified by a title. An element is playable if it has a duration and a method play().
- An Audio Record🎵 is playable and has associated also a volume🔊 and methods volumeDown() and volumeUp() to regulate it. If played, repeat for a number of times equal to the duration and print the title concatenated at a sequence of exclamation marks equal to the volume.
- A Video🎞️ is playable and has associated at an adjustable volume similar to that of Audio Recording🎵 and also has a brightness🎚️ and methods lightUp() and lightDown() to regulate it. if played, repeat for a number of times equal to the duration the print of the title concatenated at a sequence of exclamation marks of length equal to the volume and next a sequence of asterisks of length equal to the brightness.
- An Image🖼️ isn't playable, but it has an adjustable brightness similar to that of Videos🎞️ and a method show() that print the title concatenated at a sequence of asterisks of length equal to the brightness.
- Run a Multimedia Element means that you call a methos show() for an Image🖼️ or method play() if it's playable🎞️🎵.
